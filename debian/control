Description: DSP library and command-line tool for Software Defined Radio
 libcsdr is a set of simple DSP routines for Software Defined Radio. It
 is mostly useful for AM/FM/SSB demodulation and spectrum display. The
 package comes with a command-line tool csdr, which lets you build DSP
 processing chains by shell pipes. The code of libcsdr was intended to
 be easy to follow. libcsdr was designed to use auto-vectorization
 available in gcc. It means that it can achieve some speedup by taking
 advantage of SIMD command sets available in today's CPUs (e.g. SSE on
 x86 and NEON on ARM).
