WSPR TODO

Derive a fractional_decimator_cc from fractional_decimator_ff so WSPR can be used with
IQ sources other than just the demo file.

Make more "csdr-style"
    use dual-path FFT/demod?
    break into smaller csdr units connected by pipes?

UI
    set band control
    initial FFT black lines
    zoom_max_level_hps setting
    scrolling decode list (use nanoScroller)

Perform wspr.net spot uploads
    requires call/grid setup
